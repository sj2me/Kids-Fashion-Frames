# Kids-Fashion-Frames
Kids usually hate wearing glasses.  Most of what is out is not trendy,fashionable, or functional. That all changed in the last year and a half. Jonas Paul Eyewear is the brain child of Ben and Laura Harrison who are serial entrepreneurs, with an incredible "Why" to their business.
Ben and Laura have given their creativity to the calling of equipping their visually impaired son, Jonas, and other children with designer, fashion-forward kids glasses.  Upon learning Jonas was visually impaired,Ben and Laura went on a search so that Jonas could have stylish frames like his dad. The Harrison's discovered one missing factor in existing options for children : fashion-forward kids frames at an accessible price point.  Jonas Paul Eyewear exists to provide function and new form to children’s vision. <a href="http://jonaspauleyewear.com">Jonas Paul Eyewear-Designer Glasses For Kids.</a>
